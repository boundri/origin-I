# origin-I

## Purpose 
origin-I is the first iteration of boundri's hardware platform. This repo lays out our preliminary design and progress. 

## Introduction 
origin-I was created in a an attempt to prove a hypothesis. We were curious to see if haptic feedback could be used to help the blind and visually impaired-adequately measure the distance of their hand to the nearest surface, object, or person without making physical contact. So we built origin-I and were very happy with the initial results. Using the origin-I you can clearly delineate the distance of the device to the nearest surface it is angled towards.

## Design 
You can replicate origin-I by going to the assembly directory and following the instruction. 

## Demos
Once you've replicated origin-I you can then head to the src directory to run the demo scripts. 

## Current Status 
While we are happy with our inital results we also discovered many limitations in our first design including:
- The devices size is invasive to users hand
- ERM haptic motors limit the types of waveforms we can project
- Limited distance ranging of 1m

With that said we believe that origin-I may be helpful for members of the community that would like to use the hardware for similar types of applications, or to help us enhance the functionality and usability of the existing demos.

In order to continue expanding the boundri team has decided to branch development into a new device we're calling origin-II. You can find more information about origin-II by visiting the repo here.
